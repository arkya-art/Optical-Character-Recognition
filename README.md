# Optical Character Recognition

This work uses the Tesseract v4 software and OpenCV to perform OCR text recognition.

The Tesseract v4 includes a highly accurate deep learning-based model for text recognition. Tesseract, a highly popular OCR engine, was originally developed by Hewlett Packard in the 1980s and was then open-sourced in 2005. Google adopted the project in 2006 and has been sponsoring it ever since. The latest release of Tesseract (v4) supports deep learning-based OCR that is significantly more accurate.The underlying OCR engine itself utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Used the pytesseract module to bind the Tesseract software with OpenCV.
